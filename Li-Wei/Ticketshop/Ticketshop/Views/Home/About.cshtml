<p>Hello, we are Black & Yellow. We are a new programming team and aspire to be the best progamming team out there.
    <br />
    Our team consists of 5 students who are students at the Hogeschool Rotterdam.
    <br />
    This is our website "TicketShop" here we sell tickets for events like movies but also your own events.
    <br />
    TicketShop has been made in 2017 for a project given to us by our school and CGI.
    <br />
    We aim to make it easier and simpler for everyone to buy tickets and host events. 
    <br />
    <br />
    We hope all of you will enjoy Ticketshop and our future projects. :D</p>
